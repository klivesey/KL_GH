#Activity 1: Simple printing
#
#Using the lesson shell script and a text editor, create a Python script. Change the documentation to show you wrote the script.
#
#This script should do the following: 
#Print your name to the console
#Print the MATC program that you are currently enrolled in
#Print the number of semesters that you have attended at MATC
#
#Save the script as Lesson4_1.py
#
#Test the script in Python

NAME = "Ken Livesey"
PGRAM = "Security Specialist"
SEMNUM = "6th"

print (NAME + " is enrolled in the " + PGRAM + " program and is currently in his " + SEMNUM + " semester.")


# end of script
