Activity 2: Escape sequences

Using the lesson shell script and a text editor, create a Python script. Change the documentation to show you wrote the script.

This script should do the following: 
Print the string... I will finish this course with an A grade ...using a single-quoted string
Print the string... This is the grade I seek to exceed:95 ...using a double-quoted string
In the string above, insert a tab using an escape sequence between the colon and 95

Save the script as Lesson5_2.py

Test the script in Python """

#Print the string... I will finish this course with an A grade ...using a single-quoted string
print ('I will finish this course with an A grade')

#Print the string... This is the grade I seek to exceed:95 ...using a double-quoted string
#In the string above, insert a tab using an escape sequence between the colon and 95
print ("This is the grade I seek to exceed:\t95")
