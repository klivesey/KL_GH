Activity 2: Reading and writing files

Using the lesson shell script and a text editor, create a Python script. Change the documentation to show you wrote the script.

This script should do the following: 
Open the file created in the first script for read/write access
Create a for loop to print the contents of the file to the screen
Go to Wikipedia to obtain a 3 sentence definition for the Black Plague
Write the definition to the file
Close the file
Reopen the file for reading
Create a for loop to print the contents of the file to the screen
Close the file

Save the script as Lesson12_2.py

Test the script in Python"""

Although there were several competing theories as to the etiology of the Black Death, analysis of DNA from victims in northern and southern Europe published in 2010 and 2011 indicates that the pathogen responsible was the Yersinia pestis bacterium, probably causing several forms of plague"

# Print contence of file
for x in MY_HNDL:

# Write 3 sentence Black Plague definition
MY_HNDL.write (BLACK_STR)

# Close file

# Open file with read access
