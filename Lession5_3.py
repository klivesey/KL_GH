Activity 3: Using variables

Using the lesson shell script and a text editor, create a Python script. Change the documentation to show you wrote the script.

This script should do the following: 
Create a variable named title and set it equal to a double-quoted string with the following value: Warm Summer Months:\tWisconsin
Create a variable named count and give it the value of 3
Create a variable named month1 and set it equal to a single-quoted string with the following value: July
Create a variable named month2 and set it equal to a single-quoted string with the following value: August
Create a variable named month3 and set it equal to a single-quoted string with the following value: September
Print title and follow it with 2 blank lines
Print count
Print the 3 month variables each on separate lines

Save the script as Lesson5_3.py

Test the script in Python"""

# Set Vars
TITLE = "Warm Summer Months:\tWisconsin"
COUNT = 3
MONTH1 = "July"
MONTH2 = "August"
MONTH3 = "September"

print (TITLE, "\n\n\n", COUNT,"\n", MONTH1,"\n", MONTH2, "\n", MONTH3)
