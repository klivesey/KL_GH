Python Scripting Activity

Author: Ken Livesey
 
---------------------------------------------------------

Activity 1: Doing the math

Using the lesson shell script and a text editor, create a Python script. Change the documentation to show you wrote the script.

This script should do the following: 
Calculate and Print the addition of 88 to 12
Calculate and Print the subtraction of 99 from 12 (yielding a negative number)
Calculate and Print the product of 20 times 22
Create a variable named answer
Multiple 12 times 12 and add 23 to the results then divide the results by 9
You must use 2 sets of parenthesis to obtain the correct answer
Store the results in the variable
Print the variable
Create a variable named rem
Store the result of 80 modulo 12 into the variable
Print the variable

Save the script as Lesson6_1.py

Test the script in Python"""

#Calculate and Print the addition of 88 to 12
print (88 + 12)

#Calculate and Print the subtraction of 99 from 12 (yielding a negative number)
print (12 - 99)

#Calculate and Print the product of 20 times 22
VAR1 = 20 * 22
print (VAR1)

#Multiple 12 times 12 and add 23 to the results then divide the results by 9. 
#	You must use 2 sets of parenthesis to obtain the correct answer
#	Store the results in the variable
#	Print the variable
VAR2 = ((12 * 12) + 23)/9
print (VAR2)

#Create a variable named rem
#	Store the result of 80 modulo 12 into the variable
#	Print the variable
REM = 80 % 12
print (REM)
